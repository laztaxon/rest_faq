# rest_faq
a RESTful API server using the Gin web framework and GORM ORM library, targeting a SQLite database. It defines two main data models: ﻿FAQ and ﻿Tag, where an FAQ can have multiple tags through a many-to-many relationship. The server provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both FAQs and Tags, with routes set up for each operation.
